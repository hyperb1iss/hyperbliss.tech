## 🚀 Programmatic RGB Control

signalrgb-python provides a Python interface for SignalRGB Pro, enabling programmatic control of your RGB lighting ecosystem. Whether you're building automation tools, creating ambient notifications, or integrating lighting effects into your applications, this library offers a clean and intuitive API.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎨 **Effect Management**: Apply and control lighting effects programmatically
- 🖼️ **Layout Control**: Switch between different lighting configurations
- 🔆 **Brightness Control**: Adjust lighting intensity
- 🎭 **Preset Management**: Store and load lighting configurations
- 🖥️ **CLI Interface**: Control your setup through the terminal
- 🐍 **Python API**: Full programmatic control with type hints
- 🔄 **Effect Sequencing**: Create dynamic lighting sequences

## 🛠️ Developer-Focused Design

The library provides a straightforward interface for controlling SignalRGB Pro, with comprehensive documentation and type hints throughout the codebase.

```python
from signalrgb import SignalRGBClient

client = SignalRGBClient()

# Apply an effect
client.apply_effect_by_name("Ocean Waves")

# Adjust brightness
client.brightness = 75

# Switch layouts
client.current_layout = "Development Setup"

# Sequence through effects
for effect in client.get_effects():
    client.apply_effect(effect.id)
    time.sleep(5)
```

## 🖥️ Command Line Interface

Control your lighting setup directly from the terminal:

```bash
# List available effects
signalrgb effect list

# Apply an effect
signalrgb effect apply "Electric Dreams"

# Set brightness
signalrgb canvas brightness 75

# Enable RGB control
signalrgb canvas enable
```

## 🌈 Project Features

1. **Open Source**: MIT licensed, open for contributions
2. **Well Documented**: Comprehensive guides and API reference
3. **Actively Maintained**: Regular updates and community support
4. **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux support
5. **Performance**: Optimized for responsive control
