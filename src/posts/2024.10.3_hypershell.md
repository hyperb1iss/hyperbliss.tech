As a developer who lives and breathes in the Linux world, there are times when I find myself needing to use Windows. Maybe it's for testing, maybe it's for a specific tool, or maybe it's because someone handed me a Windows laptop and said, "Make it work." Whatever the reason, the transition can be jarring. That's why I created HyperShell: a custom PowerShell environment that brings the comfort and power of Linux to Windows.

## Why HyperShell?

Picture this: You're a Linux power user, forced to use a Windows machine. You instinctively type `ls` or `grep`, only to be met with that dreaded "command not found" error. Frustrating, right? That's where HyperShell comes in.

HyperShell is my answer to the question, "How can I make PowerShell feel more like home?" It's not just about aliases (though those are there too). It's about creating an environment that feels familiar to Linux users while leveraging the strengths of PowerShell.

## What Does HyperShell Do?

1. **Linux-Style Commands**: Use `ls`, `grep`, `cat`, and other Linux commands in PowerShell without missing a beat.
2. **Enhanced Prompt with Starship**: A beautiful, informative prompt powered by Starship, with a custom Dracula-inspired theme that'll make you feel right at home.
3. **Fuzzy Finding with FZF**: Find files, navigate directories, and search command history with the ease you're used to in Linux.
4. **Improved Tab Completion**: Because even in Windows, life's too short for typing out full commands.
5. **Git Integration**: Handy shortcuts for Git operations, keeping your workflow smooth no matter the OS.
6. **WSL Integration**: Seamlessly interact with your Windows Subsystem for Linux environment, bridging the gap between Windows and your preferred Linux distro.
7. **Docker Shortcuts**: For when you need to quickly check on your containers or images, just like you would in Linux.
8. **Custom Functions**: Like `mkcd` that creates a directory and immediately changes into it. It's the little things that make a CLI feel like home, right?

## Getting HyperShell

HyperShell is part of my dotfiles repository, which contains configurations for my entire development environment. You can find it at:

[https://github.com/hyperb1iss/dotfiles](https://github.com/hyperb1iss/dotfiles)

The HyperShell-specific files are located in the `hypershell` directory of the repository. Feel free to explore, fork, and customize to your heart's content!

## Setting Up HyperShell

Ready to make your PowerShell feel a bit more like bash? Here's how to get started:

1. **Install Prerequisites**:
   First, make sure you have PowerShell 7+ installed. Then, open PowerShell as an administrator and run:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   Install-Module -Name PSReadLine -Force -SkipPublishCheck
   Install-Module -Name posh-git -Force
   ```

2. **Install Required Tools**:
   We'll use Chocolatey to install some essential tools. If you don't have Chocolatey, install it first, then run:

   ```powershell
   choco install lsd fzf starship -y
   ```

3. **Configure Starship**:
   Set up the Starship prompt configuration:

   ```powershell
   mkdir -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.config"
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperb1iss/dotfiles/main/starship.toml" -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\starship.toml"
   ```

   This configuration mimics aspects of a Linux prompt, making you feel more at home.

4. **Set Up the HyperShell Profile**:
   Now, let's set up the PowerShell profile with HyperShell:

   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperb1iss/dotfiles/main/hypershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1" -OutFile $PROFILE
   ```

   This downloads the HyperShell profile directly from my dotfiles repository.

5. **Restart PowerShell**:
   Close and reopen PowerShell, or run:

   ```powershell
   . $PROFILE
   ```

Voilà! You now have a PowerShell environment that feels a lot more like your familiar Linux terminal.

## The HyperShell Experience

Once set up, you'll feel the difference immediately. Your prompt now looks and behaves much more like a Linux terminal. Try out some familiar commands:

```powershell
ls -la # List all files, including hidden ones
grep "TODO" *.txt # Search for "TODO" in all text files
cat README.md | less # View the contents of README.md with pagination
```

Need to find a file? Just hit `Ctrl+F` and start typing, just like you would with `find` in Linux. Want to quickly CD into a subdirectory? `Alt+C` has got you covered. And when you need to run that command from two hours ago? `Ctrl+R` is your time machine, just like in bash.

## Customization is Key

The beauty of HyperShell is that it's endlessly customizable, just like your Linux environment. Don't like a particular alias? Change it. Want to add your own custom function? Go for it. The `$PROFILE` file is your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` equivalent.

For example, let's say you frequently need to check your public IP. You could add this function to your profile:

```powershell
function Get-PublicIP {
    (Invoke-WebRequest -uri "http://ifconfig.me/ip").Content
}
Set-Alias -Name publicip -Value Get-PublicIP
```

Now you can just type `publicip` to get your public IP address, just like you might do with a bash alias.

## Wrapping Up

While I'll always prefer my Linux environment, HyperShell has made those Windows interludes much more bearable. It's brought a piece of Linux comfort to the Windows world, boosting my productivity when I can't be in my native environment.

Whether you're a die-hard Linux user forced to use Windows occasionally, a Windows user looking to dip your toes into a more Linux-like experience, or just someone looking to supercharge their command-line experience, give HyperShell a try.

Remember, the command line is a powerful tool, and with great power comes great responsibility… to customize it until it feels just like home! Happy scripting, and may your commands always return exit code 0, no matter what OS you're on.
