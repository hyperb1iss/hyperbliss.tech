- Particle animations with cyberpunk color scheme
- Animated gradients transitioning between primary/secondary colors

Interactive Elements:
- Hover transitions with color shifts and subtle scaling (1.05)
- Cursor-responsive animations (particles following/avoiding cursor)
- Animated underlines using gradients
- Glitch effects on click/tap events

CyberScape Animation:
- Particle colors: Purples (#a259ff), pinks (#ff75d8, #ff00ff), teals (#00fff0)
- Geometric shapes with neon outlines
- Glitch effects with controlled chaos (displacement, slices)
- Connected particle networks simulating digital data streams

UI Components:
- Card elements with subtle translucency (rgba backgrounds)
- Border effects using gradients between primary/secondary
- Dark overlays with 0.8 opacity for content areas
- Custom scrollbars with accent colors

Responsive Adaptations:
- Mobile: Reduced particle density, simpler animations
- Desktop: Full visual effects with higher particle counts
- Maintain typography hierarchy across breakpoints
- Preserve neon color scheme regardless of device
