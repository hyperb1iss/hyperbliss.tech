## The Problem

We've all been there. Vague prompts lead to endless back-and-forth. Context gets
lost between sessions. Requirements surface mid-build. Code gets thrown away.

This isn't an AI problem. It's a _context_ problem.

## The Solution

**Context engineering** is the art of structuring information to maximize AI
agent effectiveness—turning hours of work into minutes of zero-rework
implementation.

I built a presentation demonstrating these principles using a real case study:
bootstrapping **Project Haven**, a complex privacy-first voice assistant, with
Claude Code.

The numbers speak for themselves:

| What               | Result       |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Parallel agents    | 20+          |
| Research documents | 80           |
| Lines of research  | 175,000      |
| Production code    | 47,000 lines |
| Time invested      | ~6 hours     |
| Rework commits     | **Zero**     |

## The Workflow

```
Brainstorm → Handoff → Questions → Swarm → Deep Dives → Decisions → Track → Ship
```

The presentation walks through each phase with real prompts, real agent
conversations, and the actual techniques that made it work:

- **File references** over pasting content
- **Parallel swarms** for comprehensive research
- **Version currency** triggers for current docs
- **Question invitations** to surface assumptions
- **Deferred synthesis** for breadth-first exploration
- **Forced recommendations** to turn research into decisions

## The Meta Layer

Here's the fun part: the presentation about context engineering was itself built
using context engineering. I mined conversation history from Haven, synthesized
an 85KB case study, created detailed specs, and let parallel agents build the
slides while [Sibyl](https://github.com/hyperb1iss/sibyl) tracked the work.

It's context engineering all the way down.
