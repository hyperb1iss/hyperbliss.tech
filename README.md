Welcome to the source code of [hyperbliss.tech](https://hyperbliss.tech), a
cybernetic sanctuary crafted by Stefanie Jane. 🔮👩‍💻⚡

This is home base: blog, projects, resume, and an interactive particle system
called CyberScape that turns the header into a living, breathing neon
dreamscape. A place for nerds, ADHD catgirls, and magical creatures.

## 🌌 What's Inside

- 🌠 **CyberScape**: A custom Canvas2D particle system with 3D projections,
  wireframe shapes, glitch effects, and chromatic aberration, all reacting to
  your cursor
- 📜 **Blog**: Technical deep-dives on creative coding, terminal design, AI
  agent orchestration, and the demoscene
- 🔧 **Projects**: 24 open source projects across Rust, TypeScript, and Python
- 🎨 **SilkCircuit aesthetic**: Purple gradients, neon cyan accents, and plasma
  pink everywhere

## 🌠 CyberScape

The header isn't just a gradient. It's a custom particle system with roots in
the 8-bit demoscene: gl-matrix for 3D math, Canvas2D for rendering, particles
that drift and connect, wireframe shapes that rotate in space, glitch effects
that fire at random, and chromatic aberration for that authentic CRT feel. The
whole thing adapts to screen size and device capability, so it looks good
everywhere without melting your phone.

## 📝 Content

Blog posts and project pages are markdown files in `content/` with YAML
frontmatter. Page configs (home, about) are JSON. Everything is read from disk
at build time with gray-matter and rendered with react-markdown + remark-gfm. No
CMS, no database, no cloud dependency. Just files.

## 🎨 Color Palette

Cosmic Purple   #a259ff    Primary brand
Neon Pink       #ff75d8    Accent energy
Digital Cyan    #00fff0    Tech highlight
